Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1
================================================

## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
activity<-read.csv("activity.csv")

#activity$date<-strptime(activity$date, format="%Y-%m-%d")
str(activity)
```



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Histogram:
```{r}
stepsbyday<-aggregate(steps ~ date,activity, sum  )
hist(stepsbyday$steps)
```



The mean total number of steps taken per day is:
```{r}
mean(stepsbyday$steps)
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
